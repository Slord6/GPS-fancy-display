# GPS-fancy-display
 M5StickC GPS unit displays


Requires the [TinyGPS++ Lib ](http://arduiniana.org/libraries/tinygpsplus/) and the [GPS unit](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/mini-gps-bds-unit)

# Controls

- BtnA cycles through the screens; Positional/Speed/Heading/Time
- BtnB cycles through secondary displays, eg speed units. It also forces a GUI redraw so on screens without secondary displays can be used as a 'force-screen-update'.
